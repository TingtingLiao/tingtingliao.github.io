## 0. Method

- Learn a mirror label $$k \in [0, 1]$$ for each guassian point.

## 1. Plane Fitting

<!-- **Clean Point Cloud**  -->

For any point  $$p = (x, y, z)^‚ä§$$  on the plane satisfies:

$$
n^{T}p+d=0
$$

This equals to minimizing the least squares error:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{m} (n^T(p_i - \mathbf{c}))^2
$$

we approximate the solution as $$\mathbf{c} = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} \mathbf{p}_i$$, $$d=-n^T\mathbf{c}$$ and normal $$n$$ of the plane as the eigenvector of the smallest eigenvalue of the covariance matrix:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{m} (\mathbf{p}_i - \mathbf{c})(\mathbf{p}_i - \mathbf{c})^T
$$
